# Portfolio
This is my Portfolio. It was build and design with html, Css, javascript, Node.js, for the logo design it was designed with adobe illustrator (SVG).

UPDATE:
Build a Portfolio template called AE_BLOGS.

Included the constants folder, where you can directly add your details and it'll get reflected throughout the application.

This is a simple portfolio template and minimalistic website.
The design is inspired by one of my big brother (OluwaTobi Emmanuel).The website is completely Open Source, you can use it for whatever purpose you want.
